# AI-ML-
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is the technology of future . It has lots of areas to explore, learn & create the technologies of future. It is already in existence and we will move forward and create much more new inventions in AI&ML . This repository consists of my experience and works that I did during the period of exploring AI&ML.  I have worked with jupyter notebook (python) during this journey.  In this repository I have displayed the code to work with AI&ML  and a mini-project on Face Recognition with ML. Inorder to run these codes please install anaconda navigator(anaconda navigator->jupyter notebook-> download the code in working directory->run each cell). This project and related codes can be used as references when you begin to learn about AI&ML.
